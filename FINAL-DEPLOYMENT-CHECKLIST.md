## 🚀 Final Deployment Options

### **Option A: Automated (Recommended)**
1. **Setup GitHub Token** (see `GITHUB-TOKEN-SETUP.md`)
2. **Execute script:**
   ```bash
   export GH_TOKEN="your_token_here"
   ./auto-merge-hotfix.sh
   ```
3. **Script automatically:**
   - Creates PR from hotfix branch
   - Merges PR with squash commit
   - Waits for deployment
   - Verifies all endpoints are clean
   - Reports final status

### **Option B: Manual**
1. **Create PR:** https://github.com/W73QB/deal-aggregator-facebook/compare/main...hotfix/remove-cicd-debugline
2. **Merge PR** after review
3. **Wait for deployment** (~5-10 minutes)
4. **Manual verification:**
   ```bash
   curl -s https://dealradarus.com/ | grep "CI/CD Test" || echo "✅ Clean"
   curl -s https://dealradarus.com/index.html | grep "CI/CD Test" || echo "✅ Clean"
   ```
