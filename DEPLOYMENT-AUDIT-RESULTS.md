|-----------|------------|-----------|--------|
| **File Structure** | ✅ **Updated** | ✅ **Matches** | Sync OK |
| **CI/CD Debug Content** | ✅ **Removed** | ❌ **Still Present** | **DEPLOYMENT NEEDED** |

## 🚨 Root Cause Analysis

### **Issue:** Repository-Production Deployment Gap
- **Repository state:** All optimizations and cleanups completed
- **Production state:** Running outdated version with debug content
- **Cause:** Missing deployment trigger or failed deployment process

### **Evidence:**
1. **Repository audit:** ✅ All files clean and optimized
2. **Live site audit:** ❌ Still contains outdated content
3. **File comparison:** Structure matches, but content is stale
