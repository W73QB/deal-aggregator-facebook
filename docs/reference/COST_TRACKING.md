## 📊 Performance Baseline (Reference)

**From Phase 5 Testing (October 1, 2025):**

### Railway API Response Times
- **p50 (median):** 550ms ✅ Target: < 1000ms
- **p95:** 762ms ✅ Target: < 2000ms
- **p99:** 804ms ✅ Target: < 5000ms

### Target SLAs
- **p95 < 2s:** ✅ Currently 762ms (62% margin)
- **p99 < 5s:** ✅ Currently 804ms (84% margin)
- **Error rate < 1%:** ✅ Currently 0%
- **Uptime > 99.9%:** ⏳ TBD (need 30 days data)

### Degradation Alert Thresholds
- **p95 > 2s for 10 minutes** → Investigate
- **p99 > 5s for 5 minutes** → Page on-call
- **Error rate > 1% for 5 minutes** → Page on-call
- **Uptime < 99% over 24h** → Review and optimize

## 💡 Optimization Opportunities

### Current State (October 2025)
- ✅ Well within free tier limits (Neon)
- ✅ Minimal Railway costs ($5/month)
- ✅ No immediate optimization needed

### Future Considerations
- **If storage grows > 2 GB:** Archive old data, implement retention policies
- **If compute hours increase:** Optimize queries, add caching layer
- **If traffic 10x:** Consider Railway Pro plan ($20/month) or Vercel Enterprise
