## What is a Crypto Wallet?

Contrary to popular belief, a wallet does not actually "store" your coins. Your coins live on the blockchain. A wallet stores your **Private Keys**—the password needed to access and move those coins.

## Types of Wallets

### 1. Hot Wallets (Software)
Connected to the internet. Convenient for daily trading but less secure.
- **Mobile Apps**: Trust Wallet, Exodus.
- **Browser Extensions**: MetaMask, Phantom.
- **Best For**: Small amounts, interacting with DeFi apps.

### 2. Cold Wallets (Hardware)
Offline devices. Extremely secure as keys never touch the internet.
- **Devices**: Ledger Nano X, Trezor Safe 3.
- **Best For**: Long-term storage (HODLing) of large amounts.

### 3. Custodial Wallets (Exchanges)
Wallets managed by an exchange (like Binance). You don't own the keys.
- **Pros**: Easy password recovery.
- **Cons**: If the exchange goes bankrupt (like FTX), you lose your funds.

## Which One Do You Need?

| Feature | Hot Wallet | Cold Wallet | Exchange |
|---------|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Security** | Medium | High | Low |
| **Convenience** | High | Low | High |
| **Cost** | Free | $50 - $150 | Free |
| **Recovery** | Seed Phrase | Seed Phrase | Customer Support |

## Step-by-Step: Setting Up a Software Wallet

1. Download a reputable wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
2. **Write down your Secret Recovery Phrase** (12-24 words) on paper.
3. **NEVER** share this phrase or type it into a website.
4. Create a strong password for the app.
5. Send a small test transaction before moving large funds.

## Security Best Practices

- **Never take a screenshot** of your seed phrase.
- **Use a metal backup** for fire/water protection.
- **Use separate wallets** for long-term storage and daily interactions.
- **Double-check addresses** before sending (beware of clipboard malware).

## Conclusion

Self-custody is the core ethos of crypto. Taking control of your wealth is empowering, but it comes with responsibility. Start with a hot wallet to learn, then upgrade to a hardware wallet as your portfolio grows.
