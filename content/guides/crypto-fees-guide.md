## The Hidden Cost of Trading

New investors often look at the price of Bitcoin but ignore the costs of acquiring it. High fees can significantly eat into your profits, especially if you trade frequently.

## Types of Exchange Fees

### 1. Trading Fees (Maker vs. Taker)
- **Maker**: You place a Limit Order that sits on the order book (adds liquidity). usually cheaper (0.0% - 0.1%).
- **Taker**: You place a Market Order that executes immediately (removes liquidity). Usually more expensive (0.1% - 0.5%).

**Tip**: Use Limit Orders whenever possible to save money.

### 2. Deposit/Withdrawal Fees
- **Fiat Deposit**: Credit cards often charge 2-4%. Bank transfers are usually free.
- **Crypto Withdrawal**: Exchanges charge a flat fee to move crypto out. (e.g., 0.0005 BTC).

### 3. Spread
On "easy buy" interfaces (like Coinbase basic), the price is often marked up by 1-2% above the real market price. Always use "Pro" or "Advanced" trading interfaces to avoid this.

## Network Fees (Gas)

When you move crypto on-chain, you pay miners/validators.
- **Bitcoin**: Fees depend on block space demand (measured in sats/vByte).
- **Ethereum**: "Gas" fees can be volatile. A simple transfer might cost $2, but a complex DeFi swap could cost $50 during congestion.

**Tip**: Check gas trackers (like Etherscan) and transact during weekends when the network is quieter.
