## Introduction to Technical Analysis (TA)

Technical Analysis is the art of predicting future price movements based on historical data. While it's not a crystal ball, it helps traders identify high-probability setups.

## 1. The Candlestick Chart

The most common chart type. Each "candle" represents a specific time period (e.g., 1 day, 1 hour).

- **Green Candle**: Price closed higher than it opened (Bullish).
- **Red Candle**: Price closed lower than it opened (Bearish).
- **Body**: The range between Open and Close.
- **Wick (Shadow)**: The highs and lows reached during that period. Long wicks indicate rejection of that price level.

## 2. Support and Resistance

The foundation of all trading strategies.
- **Support**: A price floor where buying interest is strong enough to overcome selling pressure. (Price bounces up).
- **Resistance**: A price ceiling where selling pressure overcomes buying interest. (Price rejects down).

**Strategy**: Buy at Support, Sell at Resistance. Breakouts occur when price smashes through these levels.

## 3. Trend Lines

Markets move in trends.
- **Uptrend**: Higher Highs (HH) and Higher Lows (HL).
- **Downtrend**: Lower Highs (LH) and Lower Lows (LL).

Draw a line connecting the lows in an uptrend. If price breaks below this line, the trend might be reversing.

## 4. Key Indicators

### Moving Averages (MA)
Smooths out price action to show the trend direction.
- **Golden Cross**: When the short-term MA (50-day) crosses above the long-term MA (200-day). Very Bullish.
- **Death Cross**: The opposite. Very Bearish.

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Measures momentum (0-100).
- **Overbought (>70)**: Price might be too high and due for a correction.
- **Oversold (<30)**: Price might be too low and due for a bounce.

### Volume
Confirmed moves have high volume. If price rises but volume is low, it's a weak move that might reverse.

## Conclusion

TA is a tool for risk management, not gambling. No indicator works 100% of the time. Always combine TA with fundamental analysis and never risk more than you can afford to lose.
