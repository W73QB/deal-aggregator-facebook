## Security

OKX was one of the first to implement **ZK-Proof of Reserves**, allowing users to cryptographically verify that their specific liability is included in the exchange's solvency proof.

## Conclusion

If you are interested in DeFi, NFTs, and the broader Web3 ecosystem but want the safety net of a centralized account, OKX is your best bet.
