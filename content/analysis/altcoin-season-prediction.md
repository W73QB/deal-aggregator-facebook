## The Cycle of Wealth Rotation

In every crypto cycle, wealth rotates in a predictable pattern:
1. **Bitcoin** leads the rally (First mover).
2. **Ethereum** catches up.
3. **Large Caps** (Solana, BNB, etc.) pump.
4. **Mid/Small Caps** go parabolic (Altseason).

Currently, we are in the transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2. Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) is hovering around 54%, facing stiff resistance.

## Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) Analysis

BTC.D has been in an uptrend for 2 years. However, the chart is showing signs of exhaustion:
- **Bearish Divergence** on the weekly RSI.
- **Double Top** formation at 55%.

A breakdown below 52% would confirm the start of Altseason.

## Leading Indicators

### ETH/BTC Ratio
The Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio is the primary gauge for altcoin strength. It has bounced off the 0.05 level—a historical support zone. If ETH/BTC reclaims 0.06, expect altcoins to outperform Bitcoin significantly.

### Total3 (Crypto Market Cap excl. BTC & ETH)
The Total3 chart has just broken out of a multi-year accumulation range. This indicates that fresh capital is entering the altcoin market directly, bypassing Bitcoin.

## Top Sectors to Watch

1. **AI & DePIN**: Projects combining Artificial Intelligence and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure are the narrative leaders of 2026.
2. **Gaming**: With major game releases scheduled for Q2, gaming tokens are undervalued.
3. **Layer 2s**: Optimism, Arbitrum, and ZK-rollups continue to absorb Ethereum's liquidity.

## Risk Management

Altseason is volatile.
- **Strategy**: Take profits on the way up. Do not marry your bags.
- **Warning**: When your Uber driver starts talking about "the next 100x gem," it's time to exit.

## Prediction

We expect **Altseason to officially begin in March 2026**, peaking in late summer. Prepare your portfolios now by accumulating high-conviction plays during current dips.
