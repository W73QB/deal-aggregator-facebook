## Market Overview

Bitcoin has been consolidating in the $90,000 - $98,000 range for the past three weeks. This period of accumulation typically precedes a significant volatility expansion. With institutional inflows remaining positive for 15 consecutive days, the bias is heavily skewed to the upside.

## Technical Analysis

### Weekly Timeframe
On the weekly chart, Bitcoin has formed a massive **Cup and Handle** pattern, with the handle nearing completion. The measured move from this pattern targets the $150,000 region.
- **RSI**: The Relative Strength Index is at 62, leaving plenty of room for upward movement before hitting overbought territory.
- **Moving Averages**: Price is well above the 20-week and 50-week SMAs, confirming a strong bull trend.

### Daily Timeframe
The daily chart shows a **Bull Flag** formation. A breakout above $98,500 would confirm continuation.
- **Support**: $88,000 (Strong buyer interest)
- **Resistance**: $100,000 (Psychological & Option Wall)

## On-Chain Metrics

### MVRV Ratio
The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score is currently 2.5. Historically, cycle peaks occur when this metric exceeds 7.0. This suggests we are only in the mid-phase of the bull cycle.

### Miner Capitulation
Hash ribbons have printed a "Buy" signal, indicating that miner capitulation is over and hash rate is reaching new all-time highs.

## Macro Factors

- **Global Liquidity**: M2 money supply is expanding across major economies.
- **Gold Correlation**: Bitcoin's correlation with Gold is rising, cementing its status as "digital gold" amidst geopolitical uncertainty.

## Scenario Analysis

### Bull Case (70% Probability)
- Bitcoin breaks $100k in mid-February.
- FOMO drives price rapidly to $120k before a pullback.
- Altcoins bleed against BTC initially, then rally.

### Bear Case (30% Probability)
- Rejection at $98k leads to a correction down to $82k.
- Long leverage flush needed to reset funding rates.

## Conclusion

The stars are aligning for Bitcoin. February is historically a strong month for crypto, and with the ETF catalysts fully active, the path of least resistance is up. Investors should look to accumulate on any dips near $90k.
