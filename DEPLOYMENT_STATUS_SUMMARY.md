### ✅ Phase 3: Railway Deployment (100% COMPLETE)
**Time:** 8 minutes deployment + documentation

**Deployment Complete:**
- ✅ Railway CLI v4.10.0 installed from GitHub source

**Railway URL:** https://deal-aggregator-api-production.up.railway.app

**Test Results:**
- ✅ `/api/simple-test` - Returns correct response (NOT blog posts!)
- ✅ `/api/posts` - Returns 5 blog posts correctly
- ✅ `/api/health` - Status: HEALTHY (DB connected, 2698ms)
