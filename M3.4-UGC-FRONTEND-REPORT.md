## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Redux State Management Structure
```javascript
// Store Structure
{
  reviews: {
    items: [...],           // Review objects
    dealStats: {...},       // Average rating, count
    pagination: {...},      // Current page, total pages
    loading: boolean,       // Loading state
    error: string|null      // Error message
  },
  comments: {
    items: [...],           // Flat comment array
    tree: {...},            // Tree structure for threading
    loading: boolean,
    error: string|null
  },
  reports: {
    items: [...],           // Report objects
    stats: {...},           // Report statistics
    filters: {...},         // Active filters
    loading: boolean,
    error: string|null
  },
  auth: {
    user: {...}|null,       // Current user object
    token: string|null,     // JWT token
    isAuthenticated: boolean
  },
  notifications: {
    items: [...],           // Active notifications
    queue: [...],           // Notification queue
    settings: {...}         // Notification settings
  }
}
```

### API Integration Patterns
```javascript
// AsyncThunk Pattern for API calls
export const fetchReviewsByDeal = createAsyncThunk(
  'reviews/fetchReviewsByDeal',
  async ({ dealId, page = 1, limit = 10 }, { rejectWithValue }) => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`/reviews/deal/${dealId}?page=${page}&limit=${limit}`);
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch reviews');
      return await response.json();
    } catch (error) {
      return rejectWithValue(error.message);
    }
  }
);
```

### Component Architecture Pattern
```javascript
// Higher-Order Component Pattern
const ReviewCard = ({ review, currentUser, onEdit, onDelete, onVote }) => {
  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);
  const isOwner = currentUser?.id === review.user.id;
  
  return (
    <div className="review-card" data-cy="review-card">
      {/* Review content with conditional editing */}
      {isOwner && <OwnerActions onEdit={onEdit} onDelete={onDelete} />}
      <VotingSection onVote={onVote} votes={review.votes} />
    </div>
  );
};
```
